**How to run:**
First, compile the program: `g++ gamestat.cpp -o gamestat`
Run the executable/output file: `./gamestat`

**Bonus Features:**
None, I focused on completing the core requirements

**Known Bugs/Limitations:**
This version current supports only a single character at a time, and does not save data between runs. All character information is lost when program is closed. 

**Reflection:**
The biggest challenging was handling input validation, especially when users enter letters when the program is expecting numbers. I also found it challenging to adjust the output formatting so stats display clearly and was close to the example
